- 👋 Hi, I’m @ianbarrodale
- 👀 I’m interested in connecting with others who would agree to test a forthcoming fortran 90 subroutine that will be an improved version of the 50-year-old CACM Algorithm 478 for solving over-determined systems of linear equations in the L1 norm...
- 🌱 I’m currently working on this project with another retired guy in Oxford England who is an experienced programmer ....
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with potential 'testers' early in 2022 prior to releasing the code for general use at no charge ...
- 📫 I can be reached at ianbarrodale@gmail.com ...
